Jupyter Notebook Format Checklist

Introduction Section:

Markdown cell: Briefly explain what gravitational lensing is and what Einstein rings are.

Markdown cell: Introduce PyAutoLens and the goal of the project.

Background and Theory:

Markdown cell: Outline the basic formulas (gravitational lensing equation, mention the Fourier transform, and how noise is added).

Code cell: Optionally show a small example of a Fourier transform in Python (just a quick demo).

Loading and Using an Image:

Code cell: Load a publicly available image (Hubble or a landscape).

Markdown cell: Explain what the image is and what you’re going to do with it.

Applying the Lensing Model:

Code cell: Use PyAutoLens to simulate the lensing effect.

Markdown cell: Explain the key variables you used and what they do.

Noise and Filtering:

Code cell: Add simulated noise to the image and then apply a filter (like a Wiener filter) to clean it up.

Markdown cell: Describe the process and show before-and-after images.

Conclusion:

Markdown cell: Summarize what you did, what the results show, and how it ties back to the class concepts.
