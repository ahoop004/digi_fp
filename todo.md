## TODO

- [ ] Refactor the forward pipeline into composable modules (sources, lensing operator, transforms) with clearer boundaries.
- [ ] Unify inverse solvers under a single interface and keep hooks for adding new regularizers/priors.
- [ ] Add lightweight docs in `README.md` for the mask controls and lens-light lock to help users navigate the GUI.
